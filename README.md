# KDE Plasma Solarized

![KDE Plasma Solarized Dark and Light](screenshots/kde_plasma_solarized.png)

This repository contains Solarized Dark and Light color schemes for KDE Plasma.

The color schemes are based on the official Breeze Dark and Light color schemes that come pre-installed with KDE Plasma.
I simply replaced each color with the closest equivalent from the [official Solarized color schemes](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) by Ethan Schoonover.

## Installation

Simply download either the dark or light variant of the color scheme file from this repository and place it into your `~/.local/share/color-schemes/`.
You can then select the color scheme from _System Settings > Appearance > Colors_.

You can also use a tool like `wget` to download the files:

``` bash
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ret2src/kde-plasma-solarized/main/BreezeSolarizedDark.colors -O ~/.local/share/color-schemes/BreezeSolarizedDark.colors

$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ret2src/kde-plasma-solarized/main/BreezeSolarizedLight.colors -O ~/.local/share/color-schemes/BreezeSolarizedLight.colors
```

## Accent Color

If you're using a current version of KDE Plasma, you'll have the choice to set an accent color.
For an unobtrusive look, I recommend you set it to `#657b83`, which is color `base 0` in the Solarized color scheme.
Alternatively, if you prefer less decency and some more "pop" on your desktop, set it to one of the other Solarized accent colors shown below.

### Base 0 Accent Color (#657b83)
